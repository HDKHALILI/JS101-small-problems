Member Directory

Caroline manages the member directory of her club and decided to implement a program she can use for doing that. Since the club is not very big, it's sufficient for her to keep the members' names and phone numbers in an object. Later she wants to add functionality that allows her to write this object to a file.

One requirement Caroline takes very seriously is input validation. She intended for her code to strictly require that only alphabetic letters be included in the members' first and last names, separated by a space. But upon making a typo when entering the information of the newest member, she realizes that isn't the case.

Figure out why not and fix the code so that it works as expected. You may also consider writing a few more test cases to insure that the input validation requirement is properly met.

```javascript
let memberDirectory = {
  'Jane Doe': '323-8293',
  'Margaret Asbury': '989-1111',
  'Callum Beech': '533-9090',
  'Juanita Eastman': '424-1919',
};

function isValidName(name) {
  return (/^\w+ \w+$/).test(name);
}

function isValidPhone(phone) {
  return (/^\d{3}-\d{4}$/).test(phone);
}

function validMemberInfo(name, phone) {
  return isValidName(name) && isValidPhone(phone);
}

function addMember(name, phone) {
  if (validMemberInfo(name, phone)) {
    memberDirectory[name] = phone;
  } else {
    console.log('Invalid member information.');
  }
}

addMember('Laura Carlisle', '444-2223');
addMember('Rachel Garcia', '232-1191');
addMember('Earl 5mith', '331-9191');

console.log(memberDirectory);
```

The `\w` in `/^\w+ \w+$/` matches all alphabets of all cases, digits and underscore (_). This is not the behaviour we want.  
The correct rege is:
```javascript
function isValidName(name) {
  return (/^[a-z]+ [a-z]+$/i).test(name); 
}
```
